# Find Your Top Genres on Spotify!

## Overview
My app allows a user to login with their Spotify credentials and generates a pie chart of top listed to genres. The purpose of this project was to get familiar with Spotify's API. The hard part was setting up the authorization and routes to get the data I wanted. I’m going to continue working on this to work out some error handling issues and dealing with the case when a user’s token has expired. I’d also love to expand my idea further to allow users to click on the pie chart and see what artists/tracks fall into each genres.
